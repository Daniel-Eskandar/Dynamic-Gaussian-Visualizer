## Dynamic Gaussian Visualizer

This is a simple Dynamic Gaussian Splatting Visualizer specialized in head with hair models built with PyOpenGL. It's easy to install with minimum dependencies. The goal of this project is to provide a visualizer focused on head models with hair strands as those in *(paper).*

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Eskandar/Dynamic-Gaussian-Visualizer.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the viewer and check how to use UI in the "help" panel.

```
python main.py
```

The Gaussian file loader is compatible with the official implementation but works its best with models as in *(paper)*. For files with hair strands it is necessary for these gaussiansâ€™ means, scales and rotations to be the first rows in the ply file. Once in this order, the following command can be run to save the number of hair strands, `nhairs`, and number of gaussians per strand, `ngauss_strand` to the ply file:

```
python utils/util.py my_path --n_strands=12000 --n_gaussians_per_strand=31
```

For the curls feature to load the rotation matrices instead of computing them on the fly, the following command can be run to pre-compute these where `nsamples` is the number of evenly spaced values for both amplitude and frequency, and `max_amp` and `max_freq` :

```
python utils/frenet_arcle.py my_path n_samples=0 --max_amp=0.025 --max_freq=3
```

Finally, for the frames to be loaded as a single numpy array and getting a speedup by reducing the number of read operations the following python script takes the directory in which the files `frame_#_mean_frenet.npy`, `frame_#_rot_frenet.npy` , and `frame_#_scale_frenet.npy` and whether the rotation is represented as a rotation matrix or a quaternion:

```
python utils/frame_packer.py my+path --rot_format {quat, mat}
```
